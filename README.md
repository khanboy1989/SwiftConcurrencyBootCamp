Swift concurrency is introduced with Swift 5.5 version as you know. 

Course covers concurrency in a wide range and I wanted to take chance to show you with the source code how can each part of the swift concurrency be used. 

Most of the examples are shown in Swiftui views. 

For example:

 - Async/Await and Actors
 - Affect of Do Try Catch both on Swift concurreny
 - Different type of asyc code in Swift such as @escaping closures, combine and async await
 - How and where should we use Task in swiftui 
 - How to use Async let for groupping our async calls and waiting for all them to be completed 
 - How and Where to use the TaskGroup
 - Conversion of @escaping async code to continuation so that they can be converted to async/await 
 - How to use actos (swift's new way of defining class types)
