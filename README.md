# Swift Concurrency Bootcamp

Welcome to the **Swift Concurrency Bootcamp** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of tutorials and code samples that demonstrate how to effectively work with **Swift Concurrency**, which was introduced in **Swift 5.5**. These examples follow the **"Swiftful Thinking" YouTube channel** playlist, created by Nick Sarno. If you want to master Swift concurrency, you‚Äôre in the right place.

You can check out the full video playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dQOnNYjO58&list=PLwvDm4Vfkdphr2Dl4sY4rS9PLzPdyi8PM&index=20).

## üöÄ Motivation

Swift concurrency has revolutionized how we write asynchronous code in Swift, making it easier, cleaner, and safer. As developers, we often face challenges such as managing background tasks, handling errors in async operations, and ensuring thread safety. This repository aims to empower developers by providing a solid understanding of Swift's concurrency model, allowing you to build more efficient and robust applications.

### Why focus on concurrency?
With modern apps handling network requests, animations, and data processing, concurrency is essential for smooth user experiences. Learning to manage multiple tasks simultaneously‚Äîwithout blocking the main thread‚Äîopens the door to more performant and responsive applications. This course is structured to help you grasp every aspect of concurrency, preparing you to write cutting-edge Swift applications with confidence.

## üìö Course Content

The following sections cover a wide range of Swift concurrency topics, with real-world examples using **SwiftUI**:

- **Async/Await and Actors**:
  - Learn how Swift‚Äôs `async` and `await` keywords simplify asynchronous code by making it more readable and safer.
  - Understand how `Actors` provide a structured way to ensure thread safety when dealing with mutable shared state.

- **Error Handling in Concurrency**:
  - Explore how `do-try-catch` blocks behave in asynchronous environments, allowing you to catch errors gracefully in async code.

- **Async Code Patterns**:
  - Dive into `@escaping` closures, `Combine`, and how to integrate them with Swift‚Äôs new async/await model.

- **Using Tasks in SwiftUI**:
  - Discover how to efficiently manage concurrent tasks in SwiftUI using `Task`, enabling smooth user interactions while performing background work.

- **Grouping Asynchronous Calls**:
  - Master the use of `async let` for grouping multiple async operations and awaiting them together for more efficient concurrency.

- **TaskGroup for Advanced Concurrency**:
  - Use `TaskGroup` to manage collections of tasks that execute in parallel, offering greater control over concurrency in complex apps.

- **Converting @escaping Closures to Async/Await**:
  - Learn how to convert legacy `@escaping` code into Swift‚Äôs async/await model using `CheckedContinuation`, simplifying code and making it more maintainable.

- **Actors**:
  - Understand how `Actors` in Swift provide a way to safely manage shared mutable state across threads, preventing data races and ensuring data integrity.
